General Test Layout:
	I've got 5 models, each with 3 splits, and of those splits I've got 4 test types each with it's own reduced version using feature importance.

Tests:
	1: All variables
		- Rationale: to see how an all in variable test performs 
	2: No redundant variables
		- Rationale: I manually removed the variables I know to be redundant to one another, such as Lat/long as it's covered by Grid Num, or Unix since it's a unique value per entry 
		- Variables removed: dew point, unix, lat/long, hour
	3: No weather variables
		- Rationale: wanted to see how the model would do with only temporal and spatial info
	4: No spatial variables (aside from grid num)
		- Rationale: wanted to see how the model would do with limited spatial info

Notes:
	- Talking point: discuss why test 1 feature importance isn't trustworthy/valuable since it covers variables like Unix, which is such a specific variable 
	- Basically, tests 3 and 4 are used to see how strong weather and roadway geometrics are on their own for accident prediction 

Results from applying Feature Selection to Models:
	- For 50-50 Models:
		- 4/20 models saw a decrease in Recall
		- 8/20 models saw a decrease in Specificity
		- 4/20 models saw no change in Recall
		- 5/20 models saw no change in Specificity
	- For 75-25 Models:
		- 4/20 models saw a decrease in Recall
		- 3/20 models saw a decrease in Specificity
		- 5/20 models saw no change in Recall
		- 16/20 models saw no change in Specificity
	- For No Shift Models:
		- 3/20 models saw a decrease in Recall
		- 0/20 models saw a decrease in Specificity
		- 6/20 models saw no change in Recall
		- 20/20 models saw no change in Specificity
	- Overall, Feature Selection was good to apply, as it benefited more models than it hurt.
